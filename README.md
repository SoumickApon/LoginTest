# Load Testing with JMeter

This repository contains a sample project for load testing a login feature using JMeter.

## Features

- **Token**: The load test includes generating and using authentication tokens for login requests.
- **Username**: The username field is used to provide the username for the login request.
- **Password**: The password field is used to provide the password for the login request.
- **HTTP Post Request**: The login feature is simulated using HTTP POST requests to the login endpoint.
- **JMeter Throttle**: Throttling is applied to control the number of concurrent requests sent during the load test.
- **HTML Report**: A beautiful HTML report is generated to provide detailed insights into the load test results.
